    <h4 class="privacy-subtitle">Data Collection and Use</h4>
    <br>
    <div>
      <h5 class="privacy-category-subtitle"><i>Account Data</i></h5>
      <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">When you sign up for an account on Posters, you are asked to enter your phone number, name, school, grade level, username, age, and profile photo. We also ask that you connect at least one of your social media accounts to Posters in order to help complete your profile. This data is used to identify you to other Posters users and makes it easy for your friends to find your account on the service.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
      <h5 class="privacy-category-subtitle"><i>Contacts Data</i></h5>
      <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">When signing up for an account on Posters, you have the option to give Posters access to your address book to find friends on Posters. We will use your Contacts in order to identify other Users that you may know or that your Contacts may know and to provide you and other Users with suggestions with whom to connect, such as friends-of-friends. However, we will never send text messages to your Contacts without your explicit permission. You can invite friends to join Posters by sending them a text message with a link to install the app. The invitation may include your school’s name and the names of your friends on Posters. We do not automatically send messages to your friends on your behalf. Instead, you must send the message yourself. This means you're always in control of what messages get sent to your friends.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
      <h5 class="privacy-category-subtitle"><i>Location Data</i></h5>
      <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">Before creating an account on Posters, you have the option to give Posters access to your approximate location data. We will use your approximate location to suggest nearby schools to join and to determine if Posters is available in your area. Your approximate location data is not stored or linked to your identity, and we do not track your location after your account is created.</p>
