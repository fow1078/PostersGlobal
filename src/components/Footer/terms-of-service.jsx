        <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, POSTERS, ITS PARENT COMPANY POSTERS MEDIA LLC, AND ITS OWNERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE UNDER ANY THEORY OF LAW OR IN EQUITY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR OTHER DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM THE USE OF INABILITY TO USE OUR SERVICE OR ITS CONTENT; ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONTENT OR CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT; ANY CLAIM ATTRIBUTABLE TO ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR OTHER INACCURACIES IN THE SERVICE OR THE CONTENT); HOWSOEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF POSTERS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

        <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">If we cause damage to you and you're a consumer in the EEA, the above doesn’t apply. Instead, Posters’ liability will be limited to foreseeable damages arising due to a breach of material contractual obligations typical for this type of contract. Posters isn’t liable for damages that result from a non-material breach of any other applicable duty of care. This limitation of liability won’t apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited, to liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct, or if and to exclude our responsibility for something we have specifically promised to you in writing.</p>
        <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">This limitation of liability provision survives any cancellation, termination or suspension of your Posters account and termination of these Terms.</p>

        <h5 class="privacy-category-subtitle"><i>Arbitration and governing law</i></h5>
        <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">If a dispute arises with Posters, please contact us. We will work to address it with you quickly and informally.</p>
        <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">Should an informal resolution of the dispute prove impossible, you agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your access or use of Posters or these Terms, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this provision, shall be determined by final, binding and non-appealable arbitration.</p>
        <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">Arbitration is a less expensive, and often quicker, means for parties to resolve their dispute than filing a lawsuit in a court of law. An independent and neutral arbitrator decides the case, not a judge or jury. The arbitration award is final and not subject to review by a court. Arbitrators, however, can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.</p>
        <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Service, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision and Agreement, and that you and Posters are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms and the termination of your Posters account. Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. You can find their forms at www.adr.org.</p>
        <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">Unless you and Posters agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the City and County of San Francisco or Alameda County, California. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA Rules, except that Posters will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
        <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.</p>
        <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts, including for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service.</p>
        <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND POSTERS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION</p>
        <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE SHALL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
        <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">To the extent any claim, dispute or controversy regarding Posters or our Service isn’t arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise: you and Posters both agree that any claim or dispute regarding Posters will be resolved exclusively in a California court governed by the laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. If you are not a consumer in the EEA, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with these Terms is San Francisco County, California, or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and our dispute will be determined under California law.</p>
        <p class="privacy-policy-paragraph">If you're a consumer in the EEA, this arbitration provision does not apply to you.</p>

You and the Company acknowledge that, in the event of any third party claim that the Posters app or your possession and use of that Posters app infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, the Company, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms. You must comply with applicable third party terms of agreement when using the Posters app. You and the Company acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of these Terms as they relate to your use of the Posters app, and that, upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.</p>
